          Corporate memory is the collective knowledge, experience, and history
          of an organization. It includes the policies, procedures, and
          processes that have been developed over time to guide the operation of
          the organization, as well as the skills, expertise, and knowledge of
          its employees. Corporate memory also includes the physical and digital
          records of the organization's activities, such as meeting minutes,
          financial records, and communication logs.
        </p>
        <h2>Knowledge</h2>
        <p>
          The abilities and knowledge of your employees. Generally speaking,
          when people leave corporate memory is lost. That is to say that there
          is always information that isn't transfered or retained such as tacit
          knowledge and situational knowledge. For example, a salesperson who
          has figured out an effective method for selling to a particular
          executive might be unlikely to communicate the approach to someone who
          could replicate it. Corporate memory is made up of the knowledge and
          expertise of the organization's employees, as well as the policies and
          procedures that have been developed over time to guide the operation
          of the organization.
        </p>
        <h2>Information</h2>
        <p>
          Data designed to be consumed by people. For example, a design document
          or a training video. It is common for knowledge workers to produce
          copious amounts of documentation that is archived in a tool such as a
          knowledge management platform. It is also common for such information
          to go to waste or for similar documentation efforts to be repeated
          many times.
        </p>
        <p>
          Corporate memory includes both the physical and digital records of the
          organization's activities, such as meeting minutes, financial records,
          and communication logs.
        </p>
        <h2>Data</h2>
        <p>
          Information designed to be consumed by machine. Automation and
          decision support based on databases is a type of corporate memory that
          survives employee turnover. In some cases, replacing systems and
          changing processes results in data going dark.
        </p>
        <p>
          Corporate memory includes data about the organization's history,
          operations, and performance, as well as data about its employees,
          customers, and stakeholders.
        </p>
        <h2>Organizational Culture</h2>
        <p>
          The norms, habits and expectations of a firm. As with the culture of a
          nation, this is rooted in history and serves as a stabilizing force
          that doesn't easily change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Corporate memory is shaped by the culture of the organization, which
          includes its values, beliefs, and practices. It is important for
          organizations to have a strong corporate memory in order to maintain
          consistency and continuity in their operations.
        </p>
        Maintaining an accurate and comprehensive corporate memory is essential
        for the success of any organization. It helps the organization learn
        from its past experiences and make informed decisions about its future,
        and it ensures that key information is retained and shared within the
        organization, so that employees can access the resources and knowledge
        they need to do their jobs effectively.
