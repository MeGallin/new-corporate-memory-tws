      <h1>Corporate memory</h1>
      <p>
        Corporate memory is the ability of an organization to retain information
        to improve strategy, decision making, problem solving, operations and
        design. An organization with low corporate memory is doomed to repeat
        the same mistakes and reinvent things repeatedly in a costly loop. The
        following are the basic components of corporate memory.
      </p>
      <h2>Knowledge</h2>
      <p>
        The abilities and knowledge of your employees. Generally speaking, when
        people leave corporate memory is lost. That is to say that there is
        always information that isn't transfered or retained such as tacit
        knowledge and situational knowledge. For example, a salesperson who has
        figured out an effective method for selling to a particular executive
        might be unlikely to communicate the approach to someone who could
        replicate it.
      </p>
      <h2>Information</h2>
      <p>
        Data designed to be consumed by people. For example, a design document
        or a training video. It is common for knowledge workers to produce
        copious amounts of documentation that is archived in a tool such as a
        knowledge management platform. It is also common for such information to
        go to waste or for similar documentation efforts to be repeated many
        times.
      </p>
      <h2>Data</h2>
      <p>
        Information designed to be consumed by machine. Automation and decision
        support based on databases is a type of corporate memory that survives
        employee turnover. In some cases, replacing systems and changing
        processes results in data going dark.
      </p>
      <h2>Organizational Culture</h2>
      <p>
        The norms, habits and expectations of a firm. As with the culture of a
        nation, this is rooted in history and serves as a stabilizing force that
        doesn't easily change.
